THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE READER.

INSTRUCTION is the means to exnel messeanwith
which young wits ought to be well furnished in schoolsz
but so as that the teaching be, l. Tene, 2. Full, 3. clear,
and, 4· SOlid.

1. It will be true‚if nothing bc taught but such esis
beneficial to one’s lile3 lest therebe acause of complain-
ing afterwards. We know not neccssutnr things, because

censes well about tlte right perceiuing ene differentes ο]
things, will he to lay the grounds sor all niseum, and all
trise discuteres, and all discreet actions in one’s course of
lifes which, because it is commonly neglected in
schools‚ and the things whichure to bc learned are oller·
ed to scholars without being understood, or being rightly
presented to the semes, it cometh to pass, that the work
ol tecching and learning goeth heavily onuard, and al-
