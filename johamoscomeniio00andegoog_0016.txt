Gasrinwaw,

THERE are few of you (Ithinlr) but have seen, and
‘with great willingness made use of, (or at least perused)
marry of the toan ol this well-deserving author Mr. Jalm
Cameaiae, which, for their profitableness to the speedy
attainment of a language‚ hare been translated in several
oountries, out of Latin into their own native tongues.

Now the general vendict (after trial made) that heth

He heth therefore in some ol his latter works seemed to '

move retrograde, and striven to come nearer the reach of
tender wite: andin this present book, he hath (according
to my judgment) descended to the very bottom ol what is
tabe taught, and proceeded (as nature itsell doth) in an
orderly way3 first to exercise the senses well, by repre·
senting their objects to them, and then to fasten upon the
intellect ογ impressing the first notions of things upon it,

and linking them on to another ογ a rational discourse. .
