PREFACE.· ’ a

v'ice in taking (especially flichering) wits, and prepariug
them sor deeper studies.

3. Whence a third good will follow3 that children lc·
ing scon herennio, and drawn over with thie arcy os heed-
ing, may bc furnishcd with the lnowl ledge ef tlte prime
things that ore in the eaorld, by escort and merry pactime.
1n a word, this book will serve lor the more pleasing
using os the V rotabulum and lanua Linguarum, for which
end lt was even at the first 'chiefly intended. Yet it· tt ,
,like any, that rt be bound up in their native tongues also,

First, It will afford a device for learning to read more <
eaeilyt than hitherto, especially having a symbolical αΙΙιΙια·
bet set before it, to wit, the characters of the several let-

spelling, that most troublcsome tortura os wite, which may
wholly be avoided by this method For the oftenreading
over the book, by those larger (lescriptions of things, and
which arc set after the pictores, will be able perlectly to
beget a habit of reading

Second, The same boohicing used m Engl iah,inEngl iad

English tangue, and that from the doct t,·om because by the
aforesaid descriptions of things, the words and phrases ol ·
the whole language are found set orderly ur their own
places. And a short English Gramma't might be added
at the end, clearly resolving the speech already under-
