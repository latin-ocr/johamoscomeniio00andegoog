4 'FO THE ablron.

The prinsipal subjecta ol the Christian laith have hund ¹
‘their place amongst the rest: so that the boy who has
'learned this book need not ask his school-follow (as one
did oi late, to my knowledge) which is the higher, Jupi-
ter or God Almigkty? The most common nomenclatore
now in use makes no mention of the name of God in the
singular number3 while it teaches very particularly the‘
names os Pan and Priapus, Venus, Mars, Bocchus, and
all the monsters of gentilism= as il Latin and Latinists
were connected with no religion but the religion of idols.
it must be owing to this prejudice, so early insused, that
,many 'scholare grow up with an babitual indifference to·
ward revelatione and when the mind, thus destitute of
‘tr-uth, isat length assaulted by the allurements of vioe,
what at first was no more than ignorance and indifferenee,
degeneratos into aversion3 and they turn out positive in·
lidels and libertines· As this evil is in a progressive
state, it is time to look with eyes of impartiality (I may
say severity) into the errore ol modern education, and to
gire something of a Christian tum to the education of
'Christian children; that we may stop that torrent of hea-
then principles and loose opinions, which hath been
pouring in upon us of late years, to overthrow this church
and kingdom.

1 have taken the liberty to insert a chapter under the
title of sorano, a study much in vogue; with another on
the detege: and as the work was composed before our
Harvey had demonstrated the circulation of the blood, 1
have made the necessary alteration in that part, and cor·
rected many errors of the last edition. Iwish I had suf-
licient influence to recommend it generally sor the use of
schools, to be learned next in order alter the Latin gram-
mar and syntax3 being well assured it will lead to a copia
verborum by the shomest, surest, and pleasantest road;
and that it will also serve to prevent, in some degree, that

Paganignorance to which many boys are unfortunately ¹

left, while they are acquiring Latin in their render years,
with very contracted views, and by very insufficient me-

thods. ,
