PREFACE. Ιβ

which till they be someaohot acquaintel with things, ond
the words belonging to them, in tlte languoge which they
learn, they cannot oppreserit what they meon. And this
1 guess to be the reason why many greater persons do re·
solve sometimes not to put a child to school till he be at
least eleren or twelve years of age, presuming that he
having then taken notice of most things, will sooner get
the knowledge of the words which are applied to thamin
any language. But the gross misdemeanor of such chil-
dren, ’ior the most part, have taught many parents to be
hasty enough to send their own to school; if not that they
may leam, yet (at least) that they might be kept out of
barm's way ; and yet it they do not profit ior the time they
have been at school, (no respect at all being had of their
years) the master shall be sure enough to bear the blame.

So that a school-master had need to bend his wits to
come within the compass of a child’s capacity oi six oe
seven years of age (seeing we have now such commonly
broughtto our grammar-schoolsto leam the Latin tongue)
and to make that they may learn with as much delight
,and willingness, as himself would touch with dexterity
and ease. And at present I know no better help to ior·
ward his young scholars than this little book, which was
for this purpose contrived by the author in the German
and Latin tongues.

What profitable use may be had thereos, respecting

, chiefly that his own country and language‚he himself hath
t told you in his preiace3 but what use we may here make

of it in our grammar-schools, as it is now translated into
English, 1 shall partly declare, leaving all other men (ac-
cording to my wont) to their own discretion and liberty,
to use it or refusa it, as they please. So soon then as a
child can read English perfectly, and is brought us to
school to learn Latin, I would have him, together with his ’
accidence, to be provided of this book, in which he may at
least once a day (besides his accidente) be thus exercised.

l. Lel him loolc over the picturas wilh their general ti·
tles orinscttfitions, till he be able to turn readily to any one
ol them, and to tell its name either in English or Latin.
By this means he shall have the method oi the book in his
head3 and be easily furnished with the knowledge of most
thingst and instructed how to call them, when at any·
