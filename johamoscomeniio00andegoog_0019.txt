over, will much prepare children to go cheerfully foiward
in their grammarand school authors, especially if, whilst
they are employed herein, they be taught also to write a
fair and legible hand. '

There is one thing to bc given notice of, which l wish
could have been remedied in this translatiou3 that the
book being writ in High-Dutch, doth express many things
in reference to that country and speech, which cannete
without alteration of some pictores as well as words, be
expressed in ours: for the symbolica! alphabet is fitted lor
German children rather than for ours. And whereas the
words of that Language go orderly one for one with the
Latin, our English propriety of speech will not admit the
like. Therefore it will behove those masters that intend
to make use oi this book, to construe itverdatr'm to their
young scholars, who will quickly leam to do it of them·
selves, afterthey be once acquainted with the first words.
of nouns and verbs, and their manner oi variation.

Such a work ar thie, Iobserve to hare been formerly
much desired by some experienced teachcrs, and 1 myself
had some years since (whilst my own child lived) begun
the like, having found it most agreeable to the best witted
children, who are mear taken nst with sterteres from their·
insancy, because dy them tlte knowledge of things vvlriclr
they reem to represent (and whereof children are as yet ig·-
norant) are most easily conveyed to their understandz'ng.
But for as much as the work is now done (though in some
things not so completely as it were to be wished) lrejoiec
in the use of it, and desist in my own undertakings for the
present. And because any good thing ir the better, being
the more communicated; Ι have herein imitated achild who
‘is forward to impart to others what himself has well liked.

κ You then that have the care of little children, do not much

trouble their thoughts and clog their memories with bare
grammar rudiments, which to them are harsh in getting,
and-ilum in retaining; because indeed to them they sig·
uisy nothing, but a mere swimming cotion of ageneral
term, which they know not what it rneancth, till they com-
rehend particulars3 but by this or the like subsidiary, in-
ibrm them, first with some knowledge of things and words

' wherewith to express them, and then their rules of speaks,

hegwill bebetteruuderstood arrdmore firmly kept in mind.
